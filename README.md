I wanted to create a solution for small businesses that want a personalized dynamic website, the ability to update the content, and add pages after hand-over from the developer.
My solution allows the client to control the content on his site and build new pages with the predefined blocks that are available for each type of page.
The content is managed with Prismic, a headless CMS.<br>

I achieved this solution by:

- Create a design system in the form of blocks. Some blocks will have options to get various designs for the same block.
- Set up the structure in Prismic that allows the client to add content.
- Develop the frontend of the project that displays the content from Prismic.<br>

> Desktop and mobile view.<br>
